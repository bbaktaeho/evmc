# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

evmc (Ethereum Virtual Machine Client) is a Go library that wraps go-ethereum's `rpc` package to provide a user-friendly EVM-compatible blockchain RPC client. It supports standard Ethereum JSON-RPC namespaces plus debug/trace for data analysis and standard token interfaces.

**Status:** Work In Progress (WIP)

## Bootstrap

All development guidelines, architecture details, and conventions are documented in [BOOTSTRAP.md](BOOTSTRAP.md). Start there for any contribution or code generation task.
